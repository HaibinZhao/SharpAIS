##Project Description 
**SharpAIS** is an AIS message parser, which offers programmers a library to decode AIS receiver data in their applications. 

##General Information 

I was searching for a .NET Framework library to handle data from AIS receivers and decoding them for me. I could not find one, so this is my attempt to create such a library. 

The parser library is fully functional. It supports decoding 24 of 27 AIS receiver commands, I could find documentation on the Internet.

There is also a demo application included, it uses DotSpatial library to display the data decoded from the AIS receiver; AIS number 1,2,3 message data are displayed on a map based on OpenStreetMap.

Feel free, to comment, suggest or contact me...
